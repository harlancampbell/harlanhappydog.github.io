Statistics allows us to better understand the world around us. Working and sharing ideas with other researchers is an immensely rewarding experience for me.  My interests are in statistitcal methods, meta-research, and statistical applications in ecology, epidemiology and clinical trials.  I also am passionate about teaching statistics to others.

In 2011, I graduated from the [Simon Fraser University](https://www.stat.sfu.ca/) with a MSc in Statistics, under the supervision of [Dr. Charmaine Dean](http://www.uwo.ca/sci/dean/). My MSc thesis was subsequently published in [Statistics in Medicine](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.6021).  I then began working as a statistical consultant for EMMES Canada CRO, providing statistical services as a partner to clinicians and scientists working on a wide range of prejects. In 2015, I began work toward my PhD in Statistics at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/), where I am investigating the reliability and reproducibility of published research with [Dr. Paul Gustafson](http://www.paulgstf.com/). I expect to graduate by the end of 2018.
