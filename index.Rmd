I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I investigate questions related to breast cancer through my work as a Research Biostatistician at  in the department of Statistics. 

I graduated from the [Simon Fraser University](https://www.stat.sfu.ca/) with a MSc in Statistics in 2011, under the supervision of [Dr. Charmaine Dean](http://www.uwo.ca/sci/dean/).  My MSc thesis work was subsequently published in [Statistics in Medicine](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.6021).  In 2012, I began working as a statistical consultant for EMMES Canada, providing statistical services as a partner to clinicians and scientists. In 2015, I began work toward my PhD in Statistics at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/), where I am investigating the reliability and reproducibility of published research under the advisement of [Dr. Paul Gustafson](http://www.paulgstf.com/). I expect to graduate by the end of 2018.
