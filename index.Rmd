Statistics allows us to better understand the world around us.   My interests are in hypothesis testing, causal inference, meta-research, and statistical applications in ecology, epidemiology and clinical trials.

In 2011, I graduated from the Simon Fraser University with a MSc in Statistics, under the supervision of [Dr. Charmaine Dean](http://www.uwo.ca/sci/dean/). My MSc thesis, on the subject of model selection bias, was subsequently published in [Statistics in Medicine](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.6021).  I began work as a statistical consultant for [EMMES Canada CRO](https://secure.emmes.com/emmesweb/emmes-global/canada) in 2012, collaborating on a wide range of projects as a partner to clinicians and scientists.

In 2015, I started a PhD in Statistics at the University of British Columbia, where I am investigating the reliability and reproducibility of published research with [Dr. Paul Gustafson](http://www.paulgstf.com/). I expect to graduate by the end of 2018.
