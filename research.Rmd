#####   [Conditional equivalence testing: an alternative remedy to publication bias](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0195145)
\  H Campbell and P Gustafson, PLoS ONE 13(4): e0195145 (2018).
\  We introduce a publication policy that incorporates “conditional equivalence testing” (CET), a two-stage testing scheme in which standard NHST is followed conditionally by testing for equivalence. The idea of CET is carefully considered as it has the potential to address recent concerns about reproducibility and the limited publication of null results. In this paper we detail the implementation of CET, investigate similarities with a Bayesian testing scheme, and outline the basis for how a scientific journal could proceed to reduce publication bias while remaining relevant.
